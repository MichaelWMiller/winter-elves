Santa’s Workshop
================

We all know that Santa’s Workshop is full of Elves who each work hard all year making toys for the children of the world. But have you ever wondered just how does Santa keep those elves working year round?

Santa’s Workshop has a magical bowl of candy that always ensures there is just enough candy for all of the working Elves, true story. 

Each time an elf arrives at the workshop he or she must clock in and out. While working the elf may eat as much candy as they want from the bowl. Not all Elves require the same number of candies while they work. When an elf leaves for the day all of the candy they consumed magically returns to the bowl.

> What is the maximum number of candy missing from the bowl at any given time?

> What is the total amount of candy in the bowl for this paticular given day?
